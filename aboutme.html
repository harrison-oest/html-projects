<h1 class="about">About Me</h1>
	<p>I was born and raised in <abbr title="Kansas City, Missouri">KCMO</abbr>. I have two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. The picture below shows my family (minus my brother) at the best barbecue joint in Kansas City; Joe's KC Bar-B-Que. At the Colorado School of Mines, I am studying Computer Science with a focus in Business. My graduation date is May 2020. My eventual goal for my career is to create a product that I can market and make a business out of. As Kanye West said, <q>Who the real owner if your boss makes a salary?</q></p>

	<h3>3D Printing</h3>
		<p>I first got interested in 3D printing when I was a freshman in high school. There was a maker space very close to my house, and they were welcoming of someone interested in DIY projects at a young age. After learning about the hobby, I decided to order a kit to build my own. After a long day of assembly, my printer was complete. Over the next three years of highschool, I put <del>thousands</del> hundreds of hours of printing on my printer. Some of my prints included: customized phone cases, small figurines, and custom parts for my school's robotics team. Since the cost of the material is so cheap, it cost me anywhere from 10&#162; to 80&#162; for each piece since they weren't very big.</p>

	<h3>Mechanical Keyboards</h3>
	<!-- I wrote so much for this section, but it's because I'm passionate about this hobby -->
		<div class='keyboard_para'>
			<p>When I was doing research before building my first gaming PC, I came across a plethora of comments from other builders praising mechanical keyboards over the generic keyboards that are often bundled with computers. I was interested, but after the seeing the price tag, my interest soon faded. I found a beginner keyboard at a pawn shop a few months later for an absolute steal. This was the start of my love for this hobby. Since then, I've bought and sold 10+ keyboards in varying sizes. What is so unique about mechanical keyboards is the high level of customization. You can pick keyboards that range in size from full to 40% of a normal board. In addition, the keycaps themselves can be switched out to match a certain colorway and there are a variety of mechanical switches to choose from.</p>

		<h4>ErgoDox</h4>
		<p>The picture below shows a mechanical keyboard of someone I met at a keyboard meetup. This keyboard is unique because it splits up the keys into two different boards that can be operated with each hand. This style of board allows for a more ergonomic experience than a conventional keyboard, to mitgate problems such as carpal tunnel.</p>

		<h4>Tada68</h4>
		<p>This is a board that I built myself. I take it to work every day at my internship. This is called a 65% board, since it has 60% of the keys of a normal board, plus another 5% that includes the arrow keys and a few other keys. It has Gateron Yellow switches. I took each switch apart and put a special lubricant in to make the switches slide smoothly. The keycaps themselves are a set called SA Pulse. I also have a custom USB cable that I had someone make for me; it matches the keycap set.</p>

	<h3>Programming Languages</h3>

		<h4>I Love Python!</h4>
			<p>Python is my favorite programming language, and the following quote explains the exact reason why: 
			<br><br>
			<q>The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code -- not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.

			- Guido van Rossum</q>
			<br><br>
			My favorite library in Python is the regular expression library. I think that the amount of text processing that can be done on one line is absolutely beautiful. I've attached a code snippet below that shows the simplicity of regular expressions. This snippet will look for and return any word that starts with and uppercase "S".</p>

			<code>str = "The rain in Spain" <br>
			x = re.search(r"\bS\w+", str) <br>
			print(x.group())</code>
