The CSS3 properties used to stlye the navbar are as follows:
-> background-color : sets the background of the element referenced
-> border-style : used to set the border to a solid line
-> border-width : sets the width of the border
-> border-radius : sets the radius of the border
-> border-color : sets the color of the border
-> color : sets the color of the text of the element referenced
-> padding : allows the space between elements to be adjusted 
-> text-align : allows text to be left, centered, right, etc aligned within the element
-> z-index : sets the priority of an element so it can be forced above or behind another element

CSS3 Features Used:
-> opacity : adjusts the visibility of an element to allow be more transparent
-> font-variant : allows for the font to be either none or "small-caps", like I've done

JQuery Extra Credit:
-> For the interesting visual effect, I added a moving image into the box instead of just animating text
-> I also added the functionality to double-click the "Guesses" box to use the "location.reload()" function call to refresh the page so the user can play again
